# Madfred Steyer | Angular future with IVY

Angular private APIs:

passing inputs through url param, without router

routes: [{ path: '', component: withRoute(ComponentName) }]

usually we would have to use Activated Route, and grab url params from there.

Barrel imports and libraries are going to be used instead of ngModules.

They are going to be optional in guture.

Right now IVY is transforming ngModules into factory functions.

zone.js

-   KEY TO automatic change detection
-   monkey patches all browser objects

downsides:

-   but its bundle is quite big
-   monkey patching is changing all browser object
-   but it cannot monkeypatch async/await

zone.js is going to be optional, see angular.io/guide/roadmap

ivy is introducing higher order components

# Alex | @ngrx/component-store

property driling, passing inputs through several components

CartService {
readonly cartItems\$ = this.getCartProducts().pipe(shareReplay(1))
}

component subscribes to readonly prop from the service

but we need to be able to remove, add products

Service with behaviour subject.

State can be kept in the service, we have a private behaviour Subject, we provide cartItems\$ readonly getter, behaviour subject as observable.
We have add, remove product that invoke subject`s next method on bahaviour subject. Whenever someone manipulates on data, we get information about it.

But there might be a RACE CONDITION there, if two adds were clicked, but the first one took longer than the second one. Bug difficult to find.

**@ngrx/component-store** is a standalone lib for state management. it can replace a service like the one above.

-   **exhaustMap**: hey I am already working on sth, get lost
-   **switchMap**: hay, I am working on sth, I am discrading that and start doing what you want now
-   **concatMap**: hey, i am working on sth, ill put you on the queue

tapResponse, for catching errors in streams

## where to user componentStore?

-   provided in root? works, but this is not the first choice
-   complex independent component state ( provided in some component, providers metadata). Ties store to the lifecycle of this component.
-   reactive local ui state,
-   shared/common component state, each instance of a component, might have its own component store

## STORE:

-   logic is pushed outside of a component, we just say, hey store, dispatch some event, and effects and reducers take care of that

-   selectors, reducers, effects, usually in separate files

-   in the end store is a ONE object

-   usually lifecycle of whole application

## COMPONENT STORE:

-   this logic is inside a component that has component store injected

-   should be small, selectors, reducers, effects are all in one file

-   several objects keeping state

-   lifecycle of providing component

# Dhananjay Kumar - Simplifying Dependency Injection in Angular

tt: @debug_mode

static property is shared across objects. 5 times constructor calls on service of the same type. One property that can sum up the number of calls

**scenario 1:**: we have a service, but its not injected anywhere:
Service provided in providers in module, is included although its not used, not injected anywhere. As opposed if we used provided in root, its tree shakeable, so it won`t be included in the bundle.

providers array, **useExisting** instead of **useClass**

**scenario 2:** Lazy loaded module service provided in app module
There will be one instance of a service

use budgets

use strict mode in angular

-- tree shakable libs
instead of a single entry point, add a secondary one, by ng-packagr or bazel

common js are not tree shakable. angular 10 will throw a warning that commonjs is used

use cdn, decrease server load, low latency, high availability.

use prod and use gzip minification ( have to be done on server side)

# Ruben Bridgewater | Demystifying Memory Leaks in JavaScript

memory leak, when a computer program incorrectly manages mamory, in a way then when is is no loger needed, its not released

Mamory usage should not grow, the line of memory usage should be flat, it might go up, but should go back again.

The cheapest fastest and most reliable components are not there

## Stack vs Heap

Stack - fast, automatically managed, function calls

Heap - main memory of app, our strings numbers

Heap memory v8:

-   young generation: small, only new objects, frequent scavenges. Not lasting for long time
-   intermediate generation
-   old generation: mark sweep (algorithm for freeing memory)

Garbage collection problems:

-   Typed arrays are more efficient

-   we need to close file descriptors explicitly. When reading a file for instance.

-   Reading big data in memory. Its better to fs.createReadStream, instead of reading a whole file.

-   long strings:
    let longStr = "0".repeat(1_000_000)
    const leak = longString.slice(0, 20)

    we are going to have a memory leak there, what about rest of the characters?

    Concat might not always create new string, it might reference the other.

## how to detect and fix memory leaks?

# Michael Hladky | A deep dive into RxJS subjects

!!! GOTTA WATCH FULL PRESENTATION

Subject expose next complete, error, as public api. Whis is what is hidden on Observable. Subject **Its HOT all the time**.

Producer in observable is **inside**, in Subject its **outside**.

Observable one producer one subscriber
Subject one producer, several subscribers (multicasting)

@Lamis Chebbi talk on subjects

Subjects:

-   BehaviourSubject
    Forwards to multiple observers, needs to have initial value, replays latest value to new subscribers. New values are cached.
    It forwards a completion. If we subscribe to completed subject, it forwards completion.

-   ReplaySubject
    It informs us about whole history of a producer. Behaviour subject cached one value, ReplaySubject caches all values in array.
    If it completes and someone resubscribes to it? We will receive full history of a subject, and then reemits completion.
    We can set a **buffer size** on ReplaySubject. Size of cache array.
    **Window time** lets assign a lifetime to every single value. We can say that cache item lifespan is 5ms for instance.
    Good for history notifications

-   AsyncSubject
    Only if it completes, it emits last value.
    Where can we use?

What happens if we subscribe to already to completed Subject. It Completes again
